# How do I import a recipe from a website?

You can import recipes from most recipe websites and blogs.

1. Tap the **+** button on the Recipes tab, or tap the **... menu** in the top right
2. Select **Import from URL**
3. Paste the recipe URL and tap **Import**

The recipe will be extracted and opened in the editor for you to review before saving.

For YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram videos, use the share feature within those apps instead.

Importing recipes requires a Plus subscription.
