# What is the Discover page?

Discover lets you browse popular recipe websites without leaving the app.

Open **Discover** from the menu to see a curated list of recipe sites. You can navigate around just like a regular browser.

When you find a recipe you like, tap **Import Recipe** at the bottom of the screen to add it to your library.

Browsing is free. Importing recipes requires a Plus subscription.
