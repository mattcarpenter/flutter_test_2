# How do I generate a recipe with AI?

You can describe what you want to eat and get recipe ideas generated for you.

1. Tap the **+** button on the Recipes tab, or tap the **... menu** in the top right
2. Select **Generate with AI**
3. Describe what you want (e.g., "a warm soup with chicken")
4. Optionally toggle **Use pantry items** to get suggestions based on what you have
5. Pick a recipe idea from the list

The full recipe will be generated and opened in the editor for you to review before saving.

Generating recipes requires a Plus subscription.
