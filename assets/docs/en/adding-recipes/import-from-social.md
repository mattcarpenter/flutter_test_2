# How do I import from Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube?

You can import recipes directly from these apps using the share sheet.

1. Find a recipe video in Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube
2. Tap the **share button** within that app
3. Select **Stockpot** from the share sheet
4. Tap **Import Recipe** to add it to your library

This works best when the post includes the recipe in the description or caption. If the description is incomplete, we'll try to infer the missing details.

Importing recipes requires a Plus subscription.
