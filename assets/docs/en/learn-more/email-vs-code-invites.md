# Email vs Code Invites

There are two ways to invite someone to your household.

## Email Invites

- Enter the person's email address
- They receive an email with instructions to join
- Best when you know their exact email

## Code/Link Invites

- Generate a shareable link or code
- Anyone with the link can join
- Best for sharing via text message, social media, etc.
- You can add a label like "John's invite" to track who you sent it to

## Good to Know

- Both methods work the same once accepted
- Invite links expire after a period of time for security
- The person must not already be in a household (they can only be in one at a time)
