# Stock Status Explained

Pantry items have three stock levels that affect recipe matching and help you track what you need to buy.

## The Three Levels

**In Stock** (Green)
- You have it and it's ready to use
- Counts toward recipe ingredient matching

**Low Stock** (Orange)
- You're running low - a reminder to buy more soon
- Still counts toward recipe ingredient matching

**Out of Stock** (Red)
- You're completely out
- Does NOT count toward recipe ingredient matching

## When to Use Each

- Mark **Low Stock** when you notice you're running out
- Mark **Out of Stock** when it's completely gone
- Update to **In Stock** after shopping

**Tip:** Use the "Update Pantry" feature from your shopping list after shopping to quickly mark purchased items as In Stock.
