# What's the difference between a folder and a smart folder?

**Regular folders** work like folders on your computer - you manually add and remove recipes from them.

**Smart folders** automatically collect recipes based on rules you set:
- Recipes with specific **tags** (e.g., all recipes tagged "Dessert")
- Recipes containing certain **ingredients** (e.g., all recipes with "chicken")

Smart folders update automatically. When you add a tag to a recipe or add an ingredient that matches a smart folder's rules, that recipe will appear in the folder automatically.
