# Why can't I leave my household?

If you're the **household owner**, you must transfer ownership to another member before leaving. When you try to leave, you'll be asked to select a new owner.

If you're the **only member**, leaving will delete the household entirely. The app will warn you about this before proceeding.

**What happens to your recipes when you leave?**

Your recipes will become personal (unshared). They won't be deleted - they'll just no longer be shared with the household.
