# My invite link stopped working

Invite links expire after a period of time for security reasons.

**To fix this:**
Ask the household owner to generate a new invite link and share it with you.

**Still not working?**
Make sure you're not already in a household. You can only belong to one household at a time - if you're already in one, you'll need to leave it first before joining another.
