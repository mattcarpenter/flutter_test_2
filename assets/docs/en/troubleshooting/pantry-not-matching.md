# I added something to my pantry but it's not matching recipe ingredients

This usually happens when the ingredient and pantry item don't share any matching **aliases**.

**What are aliases?**

Aliases are alternative names used to match ingredients. For example, a pantry item called "mayonnaise" might have aliases like "mayo" and "mayonnaise" - so it can match recipe ingredients that use either name.

**Troubleshooting steps:**

1. **Check your internet connection**
   Aliases are generated automatically when you add items, but this requires an internet connection. If you added items while offline, wait until you're back online.

2. **Check the aliases on your pantry item**
   - Go to your Pantry
   - Tap the item to edit it
   - Look at the **Aliases** section
   - Add the ingredient name as an alias if it's missing

3. **Check the aliases on the recipe ingredient**
   - Open the recipe and view the ingredients list
   - Tap the colored status chip next to the ingredient (if there is one)
   - Tap the ingredient to see its aliases
   - Add the pantry item name as an alias if needed

**Tips:**
- Use common, generic names for pantry items (e.g., "Milk" instead of "2% Organic Milk")
- Aliases are case-insensitive, so "milk" matches "Milk"
- You can add as many aliases as you want
