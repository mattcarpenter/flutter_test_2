# Recipe import isn't working

If you're having trouble importing a recipe, here are some things to check.

**Make sure you're on a recipe page**

Import only works on pages that actually contain a recipe. It won't work on homepages, category pages, or search results—you need to be on the individual recipe page.

**How extraction works**

We first try to extract structured recipe data from the page. If that's not available, we use AI to find and extract the recipe. Some pages may not have enough information for either method to work.

**Try a clipping instead**

If import keeps failing, try copying the recipe text and pasting it into a new clipping. You can then use **Convert to Recipe** to extract it.

**Check your connection**

Recipe import requires an internet connection. If nothing loads, make sure you're online.
