# Cooking Mode Features

Cook mode gives you a distraction-free way to follow recipes while you're in the kitchen.

## Starting a Cook

Open any recipe and tap **Start Cooking**. You'll see one step at a time with large, easy-to-read text. Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons to move through steps.

Note: Section headers (like "For the sauce") appear but don't count as steps.

## Cooking Multiple Recipes

Making several dishes at once? You can add more recipes to your cooking session:

1. While in cook mode, tap **Add Recipe**
2. Select another recipe
3. Recipe cards appear at the bottom of the screen
4. Tap any card to switch to that recipe

Each recipe tracks its own progress independently, so you won't lose your place.

## Pausing and Resuming

Your progress is saved automatically. If you need to step away:
- Just close cook mode or the app
- Return to the recipe later
- Tap **Resume Cooking** to pick up where you left off
