# How Households Work

A household is a group that shares recipe data together - perfect for families or roommates who cook together.

## What Gets Shared

When you're in a household, everyone shares:
- All recipes and folders
- The entire pantry
- All shopping lists
- All meal plans

## What Stays Personal

These remain individual to each person:
- Account settings
- App preferences (like theme and font size)

## Key Rules

- You can only be in **one household at a time**
- The person who creates the household is the **owner**
- Owners can invite and remove members
- All members can view and edit shared data

## Leaving a Household

- If you're a regular member, you can leave anytime
- If you're the owner, you must transfer ownership to another member first
- If you're the only member, leaving deletes the household

When you leave, your recipes become personal (unshared) - they're not deleted.
