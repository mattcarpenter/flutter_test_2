# How do I add recipe ingredients to my shopping list?

1. Open the recipe you want to cook
2. Tap the **... menu** in the top right corner
3. Select **Check Pantry**
4. In the pantry modal that opens, tap the **... button**
5. Select **Add to Shopping List**
6. Choose which ingredients to add (items already in stock are unchecked by default)
7. Select which shopping list to add them to

This flow lets you see what you already have before deciding what to buy.
