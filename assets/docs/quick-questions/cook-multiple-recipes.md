# Can I use cook mode with multiple recipes at the same time?

Yes! This is helpful when you're preparing several dishes at once.

1. Open a recipe and tap **Start Cooking**
2. While in cook mode, tap **Add Recipe**
3. Select another recipe to add

You'll see recipe cards at the bottom of the screen. Tap any card to switch between recipes - each one tracks its own step progress independently.
