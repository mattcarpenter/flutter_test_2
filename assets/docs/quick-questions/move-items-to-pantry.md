# How do I move purchased items to my pantry?

After you've been shopping and checked off items on your list:

1. Check off items as you buy them by tapping them
2. A **"With marked..."** button appears at the bottom right
3. Tap it and select **Update Pantry**
4. Review the items - you'll see two sections:
   - **Items to add**: New items that will be created in your pantry
   - **Items to update**: Existing pantry items that will be marked "In Stock"
5. Uncheck anything you don't want to update
6. Tap **Update Pantry** to confirm

Your pantry will be updated and the checked items will be removed from your shopping list.
