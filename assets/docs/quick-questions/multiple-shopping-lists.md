# Can I have more than one shopping list?

Yes! You can create multiple lists for different stores or purposes (like "Costco", "Farmers Market", or "Weekly Groceries").

**To manage your lists:**
1. Go to the Shopping tab
2. Tap the **... button** in the top right
3. Select **Manage Lists**

From here you can create new lists, switch between them, or delete lists you no longer need.

Note: The default "My Shopping List" cannot be deleted.
