# How do I create a shopping list from my meal plan?

1. Go to **Meal Plans**
2. Find the date or date range you want to shop for
3. Tap the **... menu** on the date header
4. Select **Add to Shopping List**

The app will combine all ingredients from recipes planned for that day. Duplicate ingredients are automatically merged, so you won't end up with "eggs" listed three times.
