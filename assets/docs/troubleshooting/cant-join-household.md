# Why can't I join another household?

You can only belong to **one household at a time**.

If you're already in a household, you need to leave it first:

1. Go to **Settings > Household**
2. Leave your current household
3. Then accept the new invite

If you're not in a household and still can't join, the invite link may have expired. Ask the household owner to send a new invite.
