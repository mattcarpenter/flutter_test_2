# Why are some ingredients already unchecked when adding to shopping list?

When adding ingredients from a recipe to your shopping list, the app automatically unchecks items you probably don't need to buy:

- Items that are **already in your pantry** with "In Stock" status
- Items that are **already on your shopping list**

This saves you time by pre-selecting only what you actually need to buy. You can always manually check or uncheck any item before adding.
