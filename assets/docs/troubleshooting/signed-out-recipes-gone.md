# I signed out and all my recipes disappeared

Don't worry - your recipes are safe in the cloud!

**Solution:** Sign back in with the same account. All your recipes, folders, pantry items, and meal plans will reappear.

**Why this happens:**

When you sign out, the app switches to a "guest" mode with no data. When you sign back in, your personal data syncs back down from the cloud.

**Important note about syncing:**

If you sign out before your data has finished syncing, recent changes may be lost. If you see a message like "Some data hasn't finished syncing", wait for it to complete before signing out.
