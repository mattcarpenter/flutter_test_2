# Why did "Update Pantry" create a duplicate instead of updating my existing item?

This happens when the shopping list item and your existing pantry item don't share any matching **aliases**.

**Example:**
- Your shopping list has "Whole milk"
- Your pantry has "Milk"
- If these don't share an alias, the app creates a new "Whole milk" pantry item instead of updating "Milk"

**The modal shows you what will happen:**

Before confirming, the Update Pantry modal shows two sections:
- **Items to add**: These will create NEW pantry items (shown with a green "New item" label)
- **Items to update**: These will update EXISTING pantry items (shown with a status change like "Out → In Stock")

Review these sections to catch potential duplicates before they happen.

**How to fix duplicates:**
1. Delete the duplicate from your pantry
2. Edit the remaining item and add the other name as an alias (e.g., add "whole milk" to your "Milk" item)

**How to prevent duplicates:**
- Use consistent naming between your shopping list and pantry
- Add common variations as aliases to your pantry items
