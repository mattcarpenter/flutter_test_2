# Help Section Topics Outline

This document outlines potential help topics for the settings page help section. Topics are organized by feature area with bullet points describing what to cover. Final copy will need refinement based on user feedback.

---

## 1. Understanding Ingredient-Pantry Matching

**Why this matters:** The matching system is sophisticated but not immediately obvious to users.

- Explain that recipes show match percentage based on pantry items
- Clarify that only "In Stock" items count toward recipe matching (not Low Stock or Out of Stock)
- Describe the term-based matching system (e.g., "mayo" matches "Kewpie Mayo")
- Mention that matching happens automatically in the background after adding items
- Explain the colored circles next to ingredients (green = in stock, yellow = low, red = out, gray = no match)
- Note that matching is presence-based, not quantity-based (having 1 egg = having 12 eggs for matching purposes)

---

## 2. How Stock Status Works

**Why this matters:** Users may not understand the three-level system or its impact on recipe matching.

- Define the three levels: In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock
- Clarify that Low Stock and Out of Stock are informational reminders
- Emphasize: Only "In Stock" items contribute to recipe match percentages
- Explain when to use Low Stock (running low, need to buy soon) vs Out of Stock (completely gone)
- Mention that stock status can be changed from pantry list or when updating from shopping list

---

## 3. Cooking Mode Basics

**Why this matters:** Cooking mode has non-obvious features like multi-recipe support.

- Explain how to start cooking mode (tap "Start Cooking" on recipe page)
- Describe step navigation (Previous/Next buttons, or swipe)
- Note that section headers are skipped automatically in step count
- Explain accessing ingredients list while cooking (tap ingredients button)
- Mention that progress is saved - can resume later with "Resume Cooking"
- Cover adding multiple recipes to the same cooking session
- Describe switching between recipes during a cook session

---

## 4. Using Meal Plans

**Why this matters:** Date-based organization and drag/drop may not be intuitive.

- Explain that meal plans are organized by date, not meal type (breakfast/lunch/dinner)
- Describe adding recipes via the "+" button on each date
- Mention adding notes for non-recipe items (e.g., "Order pizza", "Dinner at mom's")
- Explain drag-and-drop to move items between dates (long-press the handle icon)
- Note that reordering within the same day is not currently supported
- Describe clearing all items from a date

---

## 5. Shopping List to Pantry Flow

**Why this matters:** This is a key workflow that connects two features.

- Explain marking items as "bought" by tapping them
- Describe the "With marked..." button that appears after checking items
- Walk through the "Update Pantry" option
- Clarify what happens: bought items become pantry items with "In Stock" status
- Explain that items matching existing pantry items will update the status instead of creating duplicates
- Note that processing happens in the background after closing the modal

---

## 6. Managing Multiple Shopping Lists

**Why this matters:** Users may not realize they can have more than one list.

- Explain the default "My Shopping List" always exists
- Describe creating additional lists (e.g., "Costco", "Farmers Market")
- Explain switching between lists via the dropdown
- Note that deleting a list removes all items in it
- Clarify that the default list cannot be deleted

---

## 7. Smart Folders Explained

**Why this matters:** Smart folders auto-populate but the rules aren't obvious.

- Explain that smart folders automatically collect recipes based on rules
- Describe tag-based smart folders (recipes with specific tags)
- Explain AND vs OR logic for multiple tags:
  - AND = recipe must have ALL selected tags
  - OR = recipe must have AT LEAST ONE selected tag
- Note that recipes appear in smart folders automatically when they match the criteria

---

## 8. Understanding Recipe Filters

**Why this matters:** Filters have multiple options that interact.

- List available filters: cook time, rating, pantry match %, tags
- Explain that filters persist while browsing (active until cleared)
- Describe the filter badge showing count of active filters
- Note that pantry match filter requires pantry items to be useful
- Explain that tag filter has AND/OR mode options

---

## 9. Households and Sharing

**Why this matters:** Sharing model is fundamental but has constraints.

- Explain that a household is a group that shares all data (recipes, pantry, shopping lists, meal plans)
- Clarify that you can only belong to ONE household at a time
- Describe what gets shared when joining a household (everything becomes shared)
- Explain the difference between owner and member roles
- Note that owners can invite/remove members; members can only use shared data
- Mention that leaving a household returns you to personal-only data

---

## 10. Inviting Household Members

**Why this matters:** Two invite methods exist with different use cases.

- Explain email invites: enter email, they receive notification
- Explain code invites: generate shareable link/code for anyone to use
- Describe when to use each:
  - Email: when you know the person's email
  - Code: for flexible sharing (text, social media, etc.)
- Note that invites expire after a certain period
- Explain how recipients accept invites

---

## 11. Leaving a Household

**Why this matters:** Ownership transfer requirements aren't obvious.

- Explain regular member leave: simple confirmation, no special steps
- Explain owner leave: must transfer ownership to another member first
- Describe what happens if owner is the only member: household is deleted
- Clarify that your data becomes personal again after leaving
- Note that this affects all your devices (data syncs)

---

## 12. Adding Ingredients to Shopping List from Recipes

**Why this matters:** Users may not discover this workflow.

- Explain the "Add to Shopping List" option when viewing a recipe
- Describe selection interface (checkboxes for each ingredient)
- Note that items already in pantry (in stock) are unchecked by default
- Explain choosing which shopping list to add to
- Mention that quantities are parsed and shown in bold

---

## 13. Generating Shopping Lists from Meal Plans

**Why this matters:** Powerful feature but the aggregation logic is hidden.

- Explain the "Add to Shopping List" option on meal plan date headers
- Describe how ingredients from multiple recipes are combined
- Note that duplicate ingredients are aggregated (one entry shows multiple recipe sources)
- Explain that items already on a shopping list are skipped
- Mention pantry status affects default checkbox state

---

## 14. Tags and Recipe Organization

**Why this matters:** Tags are created in a non-obvious place.

- Explain that tags must be created while editing a recipe (not in settings)
- Describe how to add tags to a recipe
- Mention that tags can be used for filtering
- Explain how to change tag colors (in Settings > Manage Tags)
- Note that deleting a tag removes it from all recipes

---

## 15. Pinned Recipes

- Explain the bookmark icon on recipe hero images
- Describe what pinning does (quick access from home screen)
- Mention the dedicated Pinned Recipes page
- Note that pinned recipes appear across all folders

---

## 16. Data Sync and Sign Out

**Why this matters:** Users may lose data if they sign out too quickly.

- Explain that data syncs automatically in the background
- Describe the sync warning when signing out with pending changes
- Recommend waiting for sync to complete before signing out
- Note that unsynced changes may be lost if you sign out early

---

## 17. Recipe Font Size and Accessibility

- Note that this affects recipe descriptions, ingredients, and steps
- Mention the live preview when changing sizes
- Clarify that titles and other UI elements are not affected

---

## 18. Home Screen Customization

**Why this matters:** Setting requires app restart, which may confuse users.

- Explain changing the default startup tab
- List options: Recipes, Shopping, Meal Plan, Pantry
- Note that changes take effect on next app launch (not immediately)

---

## 19. Understanding "Terms" for Better Matching

**Why this matters:** Advanced concept that affects matching quality.

- Explain that pantry items and ingredients have searchable "terms"
- Describe how terms enable flexible matching (brand names, abbreviations, synonyms)
- Mention that terms are generated automatically after adding items
- Note that better ingredient names lead to better matching
- Suggest using common ingredient names for best results

---

## 20. Troubleshooting: Why Isn't My Recipe Showing as Matchable?

**Why this matters:** Common frustration point.

- Check stock status: item must be "In Stock" (not Low or Out)
- Check terms: ingredient and pantry item must share a matching term
- Wait for processing: newly added items may take a moment to match
- Verify pantry item exists: search pantry to confirm
- Consider variations: "Milk" vs "Whole Milk" vs "2% Milk" may not match automatically

---

## Potential Additional Topics (Lower Priority)

These topics may be useful depending on user feedback:

21. **Folder vs Smart Folder differences** - when to use each
22. **Recently Viewed recipes** - automatic tracking, where to find
23. **Recipe sorting options** - alphabetical, rating, time, pantry match
24. **Editing recipes** - where to find edit options, saving changes
25. **Account sign-in methods** - email vs Google vs Apple differences
26. **Import/Export recipes** - when implemented, how it works
27. **Quantity parsing** - how the app interprets "2 cups milk"

---

## Notes for Final Copy

- Keep answers concise - users scanning for quick help
- Use consistent terminology (e.g., "In Stock" not "in stock" or "stocked")
- Consider adding screenshots for complex workflows
- Test help content with actual confused users to identify gaps
- Accordion sections work well - users can expand only what they need
- Consider adding "Related topics" links between connected help items
