## Section 2: Troubleshooting

Problem-oriented questions for when something isn't working as expected.

---

### Why isn't my recipe showing as "ready to make" even though I have the ingredients?

**Most common causes:**

1. **Stock status issue**: Only "In Stock" items count toward matching
   - Items marked "Low Stock" or "Out of Stock" don't count
   - Check your pantry items and update their status

2. **Name mismatch**: The ingredient and pantry item names don't share matching terms
   - "Milk" won't automatically match "2% Milk" or "Oat Milk"
   - Try using more general names in your pantry

3. **Still processing**: Newly added items take a moment to be matched
   - Wait a few seconds and refresh

4. **Not in pantry**: Double-check the item actually exists in your pantry

---

### Why is my recipe only showing 50% (or some other percentage) match?

- The percentage shows how many ingredients you have in stock
- 50% means half the ingredients are available in your pantry
- Only "In Stock" items count (not Low Stock or Out of Stock)
- Missing ingredients either aren't in your pantry or don't match by name

---

### I added something to my pantry but it's not matching recipe ingredients

- **Check the name**: Does your pantry item name overlap with the recipe ingredient?
- **Be patient**: Matching terms are generated in the background, may take a moment
- **Try common names**: "Mayo" matches better than brand names like "Kewpie Japanese Mayo"
- **Matching is by words, not quantities**: "2 cups milk" matches "Milk" pantry item

---

### Why did "Update Pantry" create a duplicate instead of updating my existing item?

- This happens when the shopping list item doesn't match your existing pantry item by name
- Example: "Whole milk" on your list won't match "Milk" in your pantry
- **To avoid**: Use consistent naming between shopping list and pantry items
- **To fix**: Delete the duplicate and update the original manually

---

### Why can't I join another household?

- You can only belong to **one household at a time**
- If you're already in a household, you must leave it first
- Go to Settings > Household and leave your current household
- Then you can accept the new invite

---

### Why can't I leave my household?

- If you're the **owner**, you must transfer ownership first
- Select another member to become the new owner when leaving
- If you're the **only member**, leaving will delete the household entirely
- Your recipes will become personal (unshared) after leaving

---

### My invite link stopped working

- Invite links expire after a certain period
- Ask the household owner to generate a new invite
- Make sure you're not already in a household (see above)

---

### I changed my home screen setting but it didn't work

- This setting only takes effect the **next time you open the app**
- Fully close the app and reopen it
- The change should now be active

---

### Why are my filters still showing results I don't want?

- Filters persist until you clear them
- Look for the filter badge showing how many filters are active
- Open the filter menu and tap "Clear" or "Reset"
- Filters are separate for each view (folder view vs search)

---

### I signed out and lost my recent changes

- Data syncs in the background but takes time
- If you sign out before sync completes, recent changes may be lost
- **Next time**: Wait for the sync warning to clear before signing out
- If you see "Some data hasn't finished syncing", wait or risk data loss

---

### Why are some ingredients already checked when adding to shopping list from a recipe?

- Items that are **already in your pantry** with "In Stock" status are unchecked by default
- Items that are **already on your shopping list** are also unchecked
- You can manually check/uncheck anything before adding

---

## Section 3: Understanding Key Features

Deeper explanations for features that need more context. These could be expandable "Learn more" sections.

---

### How Ingredient Matching Works

**The basics:**
- Recipes show a match percentage based on what's in your pantry
- Each ingredient is checked against your pantry items
- A "match" means the ingredient and pantry item share common terms

**What counts as a match:**
- Only pantry items marked "In Stock" count
- Low Stock and Out of Stock items don't contribute to the percentage
- Matching is based on ingredient names/terms, not quantities

**Tips for better matching:**
- Use common ingredient names (not brand names)
- Keep pantry stock status updated
- The system learns variations over time (e.g., "mayo" and "mayonnaise")

---

### Stock Status Explained

**Three levels:**
- **In Stock**: You have it, ready to use - counts for recipe matching
- **Low Stock**: Running low, buy soon - reminder only, doesn't count for matching
- **Out of Stock**: Completely out - doesn't count for matching

**When to use each:**
- Mark "Low Stock" when you notice you're running out
- Mark "Out of Stock" when it's completely gone
- Update to "In Stock" after shopping (or use "Update Pantry" from shopping list)

---

### How Households Work

**What is a household?**
- A group that shares all recipe data together
- One shared pantry, shopping list, and meal plan

**Key rules:**
- You can only be in **one household at a time**
- The person who creates it is the **owner**
- Owners can invite/remove members; members can use shared data

**What gets shared:**
- All recipes and folders
- The entire pantry
- All shopping lists
- All meal plans

**What stays personal:**
- Your account settings
- Your app preferences

---

### Email vs Code Invites

**Email invites:**
- You enter the person's email address
- They receive an email with instructions
- Best when you know their email

**Code invites:**
- You get a shareable link/code
- Anyone with the link can join
- Best for sharing via text, social media, etc.
- You can give it a label like "John's Guest"

Both work the same way once accepted.

---

### Cooking Mode Features

**Starting a cook:**
- Tap "Start Cooking" on any recipe page
- Navigate steps with Previous/Next buttons
- Section headers (like "For the sauce") don't count as steps

**Multi-recipe cooking:**
- Add more recipes with the "Add Recipe" button
- Recipe cards at the bottom show each recipe's progress
- Tap a card to switch to that recipe

**Pausing and resuming:**
- Your progress is saved automatically
- Return to the recipe later and tap "Resume Cooking"
- Pick up exactly where you left off
