## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Database Layer
```
PostgreSQL (Supabase)
├── households (existing, enhanced)
├── household_members (existing, enhanced with roles)
├── household_invites (NEW)
└── data_migration_jobs (NEW)

PowerSync (Local Sync)
├── Enhanced sync rules for household data
├── Bucket configuration for household sharing
└── RLS policy integration

Drift (Local Database)
├── Enhanced existing models
├── New household invite models
└── Migration tracking models
```

### Backend API Layer
```
Express.js + TypeScript
├── Authentication middleware (Supabase JWT)
├── Rate limiting (Redis-based)
├── Household controller (9 endpoints)
├── Data migration service
└── Email service (Amazon SES)
```

### Frontend Architecture
```
Flutter + Riverpod
├── Feature-based organization (/features/household/)
├── Repository layer (data access)
├── Provider layer (state management)
├── Service layer (API communication)
└── UI layer (progressive disclosure)
```

## Random notes
- For context on how to do bottom sheets in our app see lib/src/features/pantry/views/add_pantry_item_modal.dart as an example.
- Also for email sending i plan on using amazon ses but for now we can just implement placeholders and i can hook it up later.

## 🚀 Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Database & Core Models**
- [ ] Update PostgreSQL schema with new tables
- [ ] Generate Drift models and database code
- [ ] Update PowerSync sync rules and RLS policies
- [ ] Create basic repository layer

### Phase 2: Backend API
**Service Implementation**
- [ ] Implement household service with data migration
- [ ] Create API endpoints with authentication
- [ ] Set up email service (Amazon SES)
- [ ] Add rate limiting and security middleware
- [ ] Write comprehensive API tests

### Phase 3: Frontend Core
**Data & Business Logic**
- [ ] Implement repository and provider layers
- [ ] Create household management service
- [ ] Build state management with Riverpod
- [ ] Add data migration status tracking

### Phase 4: UI Implementation
**User Interface**
- [ ] Create household sharing page with progressive disclosure
- [ ] Build invitation modals (email and code)
- [ ] Implement member management interface
- [ ] Add menu integration and routing
- [ ] Create migration progress indicators

## 🔒 Security Highlights

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation on all endpoints
- Role-based access control (owner/admin/member)
- Resource-level authorization checks
- RLS policies for database access

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## 📊 Key Features Summary

### 1. Household Creation & Management
- Simple household creation with automatic owner membership
- Member role management (owner, admin, member)
- Household settings and information management

### 2. Invitation System
- **Email Invitations**: Send invites to email addresses with SES
- **Code Invitations**: Generate shareable codes for easy joining
- Invitation management (resend, revoke, expire)
- Rate limiting to prevent spam

### 3. Data Migration
- Seamless transition of personal data to household context
- Automatic data sharing when joining households
- Data retention when leaving households
- Progress tracking for large migrations

### 4. Member Management
- View household members with roles
- Remove members (owners/admins only)
- Leave household with optional ownership transfer
- Member activity tracking

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ All user stories from requirements document
