We have the skeleton for a shopping list page in our app at: lib/src/features/shopping_list/views/shopping_list_root.dart. Need to fully implement this feature now.

- Requirements
    - No search bar on the shopping listp age
    - Have a dropdown at the top of the page above the actual list of shopping list items. contains the list name in it with a down arrow to the right. Tapping it wont actually show a dropdown but rather open a new bottom sheet to manage lists
        - manage lists bottom sheet shows a listof shopping lists and has a + button in the leading section of the bottom sheet (see lib/src/features/pantry/views/pantry_root.dart  for reference onhow to create wolt bottom sheet)
        - + button just opens another bottom sheet that asks for shopping list name
        - list of shopping lists in our shopping list manager bottom sheet shows a default called “My Shopping List”. this wont have a record in the database - its just  a fallback from a UX perspective. shopping list items without a list will go under “My Shopping List”. This cannot be deleted since it wont exist in the db
        - Users can delete their own lists by swiping left to show a delete button on a list in the shopping list manager bottom sheet
        - when tapping one of the lists, it switches to that list in the main shopping list page view.
            - the new selected list name is then shown in the “dropdown” button and the bottom sheet dismisses
        - current shopping list selected is persisted in localstorage or whategver
    - in the trailing section of the top nav bar, have a plus icon that, when tapped, shows a context menu with the following options:
        - manage lists (show the list manager bottom sheet)
        - add item
    - see lib/src/features/pantry/views/pantry_root.dart for an example of how to add a plus icon to the top bar and create the context menu
    - add item bottom sheet asks for shopping list item name and quantity (see lib/src/features/pantry/views/pantry_root.dart for reference on using bottom sheets)
    - when a shopping list item, we need to canonicalize it and store its terms just as we do when adding a pantry item (see the add pantry item modal dart file for an example too)
        - NOTE: we have “normalizedTerms” on shopping list items (lib/database/models/shopping_list_items.dart) but probably wanna just rename it to “terms” to be more consistent with the pantry item model.
        - guess we’ll need another queue such as what’s in lib/src/managers for canonicalizing the shopping list item terms
    - The actual Shopping list (or its items rather) are shown under the shopping list dropdown described earlier
    - items can be deleted by swiping left and tapping the trash can
    - items have a circular ‘checkbox’ to the left that can be used to mark the item as purchased. theres a flag called “bought” in lib/database/models/shopping_list_items.dart.
    - we can ignore the property “sourceRecipeId” in that model for now
    - Need to make shoppingListId nullable in that model
    - need a FAB in the bottom right that shows when at least one item on the current list is marked as bought. the FAB text should be “With marked…”
        - actions are:
            - Update Pantry
            - Un-mark
            - Delete
        - Un-mark and delete are pretty obvious
        - Update pantry is gonna be a fun feature. I haven’t fleshed out all the details in my head yet but generally here’s what i’m thinking:
            - tapping Update Pantry will show a bottom sheet that summarizes the changes about to be made
            - basically for each shopping list item that was marked as bought and the user taps update pantry, two things can happen:
                - a shopping list item is added as a new pantry item with the stock status set to in stock
                - a shopping list item is matched with an existing pantry item based on the pantry item terms and the shopping list item terms (any term on a shopping list item matches any term on a pantry item).
                    - if pantry item stock status is anything other than ‘in stock’ (i.e. out or low) then we’d update the stock status to in-stock
            - the bottom sheet should be used to *confirm* these it’ll be broken down into 2 sections: items to add, items to update. if no items in a section then dont display the section. if no items across both sections just say nothing to update with a green check or something
            - in the two sections, each update is represented in a row with a checkbox to the left thatis default checked. user can uncheck checkbox for updates they dont want to apply
            - should be a sticky button at the bottom of the bottom sheet to update pantry, which will take all the checked rows and do those updates
            - For this to work we’ll need to do some matching of terms between pantry items and shopping list items. In other parts of the app we use some sophisticated SQL that runs in tables that are populated by triggers. we do NOT need to do anything crazy like that. pantry items and shpping list items are not too many so we can implement all that matching between terms in code. think hard about how to implement this correct and make sure the general rules from elsewhere are applied (e.g. case insensitie)
    - Out of scope is any user story related to adding shopping list items from the recipes themselves.

Please think hard (ultrathink) about how to implement. Also please let me know if there’s any edge cases that need my decision on or if I’ve left out some key information that would greatly improve the implementation results if I were to provide.
